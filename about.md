# Star Wars Database
### Created by Joshua Lee

## Purpose
  Star Wars has so much information, from the films, to the characters, to the planets, and the starships in the huge battles! Don't you wish there was a comprehensive database where you can access this information? 
Well now there is! The Star Wars Database mobile app has four buttons where you can get information on a random film, person, planet, or starship from a galaxy far, far away! 
Just press the corresponding button and out app will return information on a random entry!
